[00:00:00] Loaded alignment with 62291 taxa and 5036 sites

Alignment comprises 1 partitions and 5036 patterns

Partition 0: noname

Alignment sites / patterns: 5036 / 5036
Gaps: 14.14 %
Invariant sites: 0.00 %


NOTE: Binary MSA file created: 03_testing/LGIG.raxml.rba

Parallelization scheme autoconfig: 1 worker(s) x 16 thread(s)


NOTE: Per-rate scalers were automatically enabled to prevent numerical issues on taxa-rich alignments.
NOTE: You can use --force switch to skip this check and fall back to per-site scalers.
